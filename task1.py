===================   TASK 1   ====================
* Name: Caesar Cipher
*
* Caesar Cipher is encryption technique in which
* each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a
* letter some fixed number of positions down the
* alphabet. The method is named after Julius Caesar,
* who used it in his private correspondence.
*
* Write a script that will accept number of positions
* that should be shifted down the Unicode code points
* of character. White spaces and punctuation marks
* should be ignored during encryption process.
*
* Hint: `ord()` returns integer representing Unicode
* code point for single character.
*
* Note: Please describe in details possible cases
* in which your solution might not work.
*
* Use main() function to test your solution.
